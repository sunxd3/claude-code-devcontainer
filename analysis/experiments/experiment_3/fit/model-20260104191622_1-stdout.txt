Gradient evaluation took 3.7e-05 seconds
1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.37 seconds.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: student_t_lpdf: Scale parameter is inf, but must be positive finite! (in 'model.stan', line 29, column 2 to column 90)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
